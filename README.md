```bash
# Specify the regions of interest
regions_of_interest = ['World', 'Norway', 'United Kingdom', 'European Union (27)', 'China', 'United States']

# Filter the dataset for the specified regions and sort by year
filtered_data = data[data['Entity'].isin(regions_of_interest)].sort_values(by='Year')

# Function to create live line chart for a region
def create_live_chart(region_name):
    # Filter data for the specific region
    region_data = filtered_data[filtered_data['Entity'] == region_name]
    years = region_data['Year'].astype(int).tolist()
    sales_share = region_data['Share of new cars that are electric'].astype(float).tolist()
    
    # Create a chart for each region
    chart = lc.ChartXY(theme=Themes.White)
    chart.set_title(f"{region_name} Electric Car Sales Share")
    series = chart.add_line_series()

    # Initialize empty lists for live simulation
    x_values = []
    y_values = []

    # Set axis titles
    chart.get_default_x_axis().set_title("Year")
    chart.get_default_y_axis().set_title("Sales Share (%)")

    # Simulate live updates
    for i in range(len(years)):

Sales of electric cars started from a low base but are growing quickly in many markets.
Globally, around 1-in-4 new cars sold were electric in 2023. This share was over 90% in Norway, and in China, it was almost 40%.
In the chart below, you can explore these trends across the world.


![lines](/images/l2.gif)

```bash
# Create the chart
chart = lc.ChartXY(
    theme=lc.Themes.White,
    title='Share of new cars that are electric'
)

# Define colors for each entity
colors = [
    lc.Color(0, 0, 255),
    lc.Color(255, 165, 0), 
    lc.Color(255, 255, 0),
    lc.Color(0, 255, 0),
    lc.Color(255, 0, 0),
    lc.Color(0, 0, 0)
]

# Create a line series for each entity
line_series_dict = {}
for i, entity in enumerate(entities):
    line_series = chart.add_line_series()
    line_series.set_name(entity)
    line_series.set_line_color(colors[i])
    line_series.set_line_thickness(2)
    line_series_dict[entity] = line_series

# Customize x-axis
x_axis = chart.get_default_x_axis()
x_axis.set_title('Year')
x_axis.set_decimal_precision(0)

# Customize y-axis
y_axis = chart.get_default_y_axis()
y_axis.set_title('Battery-electric as a share of electric cars sold (percentage)')

# Add a legend to the chart
chart.add_legend(
    horizontal=False,
    title='Regions',
    x=12 , y=42,
    data=chart
)

# Open the chart
chart.open(live=True)

# Add data points with a delay to simulate real-time drawing
for index, row in data.iterrows():
    if row['Entity'] in entities:
        year = row['Year']
        emission = row['Battery-electric as a share of electric cars sold']
        if pd.notna(year) and pd.notna(emission):
            emission_million = emission / 1e6  # Convert to million metric tons
            print(f"Adding data for {row['Entity']}: Year={year}, Emission={emission_million}")
            line_series_dict[row['Entity']].add(year, emission_million)
            time.sleep(0.1)  # 0.1 second delay between each data point

chart.close()

```

- **2- Bar chart**
In 2010 and 2011, the electric vehicle market was still in its early stages, and most sales were dominated by fully battery-electric vehicles (BEVs). At that time, plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) were relatively new and underdeveloped, leading to a higher share of BEVs in the overall electric vehicle market. In the following years, as the market evolved, automakers introduced more PHEV models, which led to a decline in the share of BEVs. Many consumers began favoring hybrid options, causing the market to become more balanced between BEVs and PHEVs from 2012 onwards.

```bash
years = data['Year'].astype(str)
bev_share = data['Battery-electric as a share of electric cars sold']
chart = lc.BarChart(theme=Themes.White, title='BEV Share of New EVs')
chart.set_sorting('alphabetical')
bar_data = [{'category': year, 'value': bev_share_value} for year, bev_share_value in zip(years, bev_share)]
chart.set_data(bar_data)
chart.add_textbox('Year', x=50, y=10) 
chart.add_textbox('BEV Share (%)', x=5, y=50) 
chart.open()

```
![bar](/images/bar1.png)

- **3- Stacked bar chart**
The stacked bar chart illustrates the sales data of Battery Electric Vehicles (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEV) across various regions, including China, Europe, the USA, and the Rest of the World, from 2013 to 2023. This chart effectively visualizes how different regions and powertrain types (BEV vs. PHEV) have contributed to the growth of the global electric vehicle market during this period.
```bash
# Create a chart
chart = lc.BarChart(
    vertical=True,
    theme=lc.Themes.White,
    title='BEV and PHEV sales by Region (2013-2023)'
)
chart.set_sorting('disabled')
# Set stacked bar chart data
chart.set_data_stacked(
    years,
    chart_data
)
```
![stacked](/images/stacked.png)

- **4- Map chart**
In 2023, the global adoption of electric cars varies significantly. High adoption rates are seen in some regions with strong incentives and infrastructure. In contrast, many regions show moderate to low adoption, reflecting barriers such as cost and limited infrastructure. Overall, while there's a notable trend toward electric vehicles, substantial disparities exist globally.
```bash
# Function to create a world map chart
def create_world_map_chart(data, year):
    # Filter data for the given year
    data_year = data[data['Year'] == year]
    data_year = data_year[['Code', 'Share of new cars that are electric']].rename(columns={'Code': 'ISO_A3', 'Share of new cars that are electric': 'value'})

    # Create the MapChart for World
    chart = lc.MapChart(map_type='World', theme=lc.Themes.White)

    # Set sales share data
    chart.invalidate_region_values(data_year.to_dict(orient='records'))
    # Set title with year
    chart.set_title(f"Electric Car Sales Share - Year {year} - World")
    chart.set_palette_colors(
        steps=[
            {'value': 0, 'color': Color('#f7fbff')},
            {'value': 0.2, 'color': Color('#FFFF99')},
            {'value': 0.5, 'color': Color('#FFD700')},
            {'value': 0.7, 'color': Color('#FFCC99')},
            {'value': 0.9, 'color': Color('#FF8C00')},
            {'value': 1, 'color': Color('#FF9999')},
            {'value': 1.5, 'color': Color('#FF0000')},
            {'value': 2, 'color': Color('#238b45')},
            {'value': 25, 'color': Color('#41ae76')},
            {'value': 30, 'color': Color('#66c2a4')}
        ],
        look_up_property='value',
        percentage_values=True
    )
    # Enable hover highlighting
    chart.set_highlight_on_hover(enabled=True)
    legend = chart.add_legend(horizontal=True, title=f"Electric Car Sales Share - Year: {year}", data=chart)
    legend.set_font_size(10)
    chart.open(live=True)
    return chart

create_world_map_chart(data, 2023)

```
![map](/images/map.png)
- **5- Pie chart**
The pie chart displays the average percentage of electric vehicle sales across various countries and regions worldwide. It is evident from the chart that Norway places significant importance on the infrastructure for electric vehicle production. Iceland, Sweden, and Finland are the next leading countries in this area.
```bash
# Preparing data for the pie chart
data_grouped = data.groupby('Entity')['Share of new cars that are electric'].mean().reset_index()

regions = data_grouped['Entity']
sales_share = data_grouped['Share of new cars that are electric']

# Create the pie chart
chart = lc.PieChart(theme=Themes.White, title='Average Electric Car Sales Share by Region')

# Add slices to the pie chart
for region, share in zip(regions, sales_share):
    chart.add_slice(name=region, value=share)

# Open the chart
chart.open()
```
